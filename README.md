## Percolation

Run PercolationStats(n, t) for various values of n and t. For example:

`java-algs4 PercolationStats 100 100`
`java-algs4 PercolationStats 5 10000`
`java-algs4 PercolationStats 500 100`

Returns results similar to:

```
mean                    = 0.5967520000000001
stddev                  = 0.016317174938689543
95% confidence interval = [0.5935538337120169, 0.5999501662879833]
```

were the mean is an estimate of the percolation threshold.
